     - Cloud Functions API
     - Cloud Scheduler API
     - Cloud Build API
     - Container Registry API
     - Drive API
     - Gemini API
     - IAM API

4. **Create Service Account**
   - Go to [IAM & Admin > Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Name it "meet-organizer"
   - Grant the following roles:

     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
     ```

5. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   # Required settings
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   USERS_TO_PROCESS=user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com

   # Optional: Choose Gemini model
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash

   # Folder mapping for each meeting category (recommended to keep a "Other" folder for meetings that you dont want confused with others)
   # Your FolderId is: the last part of the drive folder URL ----> "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YourTeamMeetingFolderId"
   FOLDER_MAPPING={
       "Team Meeting": "1YourTeamMeetingFolderId",
       "Client Meeting": "1YourClientMeetingFolderId",
       "Investor Meeting": "1YourInvestorMeetingFolderId",
       "Project Update": "1YourProjectUpdateFolderId",
       "Sales Call": "1YourSalesCallFolderId",
       "HR & Recruitment": "1YourHRFolderId",
       "Other": "1YourOtherMeetingFolderId" 
   }

### Chat Integration

The application supports multiple chat platforms for notifications & summaries of important meetings. 
This is used to either forward user meetings to development team chats, etc. 
Be careful what chats you send specific meeting summaries to, as the summaries will be visible to everyone in that chat. 

Choose your preferred platform:

#### Google Chat
1. Go to your Google Chat space
2. Click the space name > Manage webhooks
3. Click "Add webhook"
4. Name it "Meeting Summaries"
5. Copy the webhook URL to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL=your-google-chat-webhook-url
   ```

#### Slack
1. Go to your Slack workspace
2. Create a new app at https://api.slack.com/apps
3. Enable "Incoming Webhooks"
4. Create a new webhook for your channel
5. Copy the webhook URL to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL=your-slack-webhook-url
   ```

#### Discord
1. Go to your Discord server
2. Edit a channel > Integrations > Create Webhook
3. Name it "Meeting Summaries"
4. Copy the webhook URL to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL=your-discord-webhook-url
   ```

#### Other Platforms
The application can be extended to support other chat platforms by:
1. Creating a webhook in your preferred platform
2. Setting the webhook URL in your `.env` file
3. Modifying `chat_api.py` to support your platform's message format

### Deployment

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK**
   - Follow the [official installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

2. **Initialize and deploy**
```bash
# Initialize gcloud
gcloud init

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable \
  cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
  cloudscheduler.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  containerregistry.googleapis.com \
  iamcredentials.googleapis.com

# Deploy using Cloud Build
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml

# Manually test the function (recommended before leaving project running)
gcloud scheduler jobs run meet-organizer-job --location=[YOUR_CHOSEN_SERVER_LOCATION]
```

### Cloud Build Configuration

The `cloudbuild.yaml` file uses Cloud Build substitutions to make deployment more flexible. You can customize the deployment by setting these variables:

```bash
# Set your desired region
gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1

# Create a new build with custom substitutions
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml \
  --substitutions=_REGION=europe-west1,_REPOSITORY=meet-organizer,_SERVICE_NAME=meet-organizer
```

The available substitutions are:
- `_REGION`: The Google Cloud region (default: europe-west1)
- `_REPOSITORY`: The Artifact Registry repository name (default: meet-organizer)
- `_SERVICE_NAME`: The Cloud Run service name (default: meet-organizer)
- `_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Automatically generated as `${_SERVICE_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- `_SERVICE_URL`: Automatically generated as `https://${_SERVICE_NAME}-${PROJECT_ID}.${_REGION}.run.app/`

To use a different region or service name, you can override these values during deployment:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml \
  --substitutions=_REGION=us-central1,_SERVICE_NAME=my-meet-organizer
```

## üîß Configuration

### Meeting Categories

The application comes with default meeting categories, but you can customize them to match your organization's needs:

1. Edit the meeting types in `gemini_api.py`:
   ```python
   # Update these categories in the determine_meeting_type method
   valid_categories = {
       "Daily Team Meeting",
       "Investor Meeting",
       "Client Meeting",
       "HR & Recruitment",
       "User Research Meeting",
       "Product Development Meeting",
       "Other"
   }
   ```

2. Update the folder mapping in your `.env` file to match your categories:
   ```json
   {
       "Daily Team Meeting": "folder-id-1",
       "Investor Meeting": "folder-id-2",
       "Client Meeting": "folder-id-3",
       "HR & Recruitment": "folder-id-4",
       "User Research Meeting": "folder-id-5",
       "Product Development Meeting": "folder-id-6",
       "Other": "folder-id-7"
   }
   ```

3. Customize the meeting type detection prompt in `gemini_api.py` to better match your organization's meeting patterns.

### Custom Properties

The application uses a custom property to track processed files. You can customize this in `drive_api.py`:

```python
# Change this property name if needed
self.PROCESSED_PROPERTY = 'meeting_processed'
```

### Scheduling

The default configuration runs every 2 hours. To modify the schedule:

```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs update http meet-organizer-job \
  --schedule "YOUR_CRON_SCHEDULE"
```

## üîç Monitoring

- View function logs:
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_function AND resource.labels.function_name=meet-organizer"
```

- Check scheduler job status:
```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs get-execution-history meet-organizer-job
```
